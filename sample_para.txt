I find the ways the brain captures, encodes, and processes information to be extremely fascinating, and your lab's work on elucidating the mechanisms of memory and learning has been a significant inspiration. I'm particularly interested in your projects combining genetics with neuroscience, and thoroughly enjoyed reading your paper on how neuronal ensemble dynamics in the hippocampus underlie episodic memory formation, as well as your work on the role of synaptic plasticity in the retrosplenial cortex in contextual learning, especially its insights into activity-dependent transcriptional and epigenetic programs critical for memory retrieval and consolidation.
